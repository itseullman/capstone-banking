          <p1>“The Russians saved me!” laughed Dr. Johnnie Baker as he regaled me with the tales of his foundations in Computer Science, in a small “conference room” within the bowels of Kent State Universities Mathematical Sciences Building. Kenneth Batcher’s beginnings had the same roots within the urgency to compete scientifically with Russia.  In 1957, Sputnik 1 was launched by The Soviet Union, the first artificial Earth satellite to break into elliptical orbit. Ken Batcher had been working on an early version of a computer with Goodyear Aerospace at their Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant, producing uranium for the United States Atomic Energy Program. It was at this time Johnnie Baker remembered:

          <br>

          “the United States government thought they better put some money into math and science”

          <br>

          “and computers.” Added Dr. Batcher’s son. Dr. Kenneth Batcher jr. 

          <br>

        This is where Dr. Batcher senior had his start in the world and development in computing.</p1>

        <p2>Kenneth E. Batcher was born on December 27, 1935. Raised in the borough of Queens, New York City, he would never quite like the way of life in the city. Coming from a lineage of science and electronics, his father, Ralph R. Batcher was an early pioneer in the world of television, penning a column in the New York Sun for hobbyists to build their own versions of tube TVs. Graduating with a degree in Radio Engineering (Universities didn’t commonly offer electrical engineering degrees yet!) he spent both World Wars reverse engineering the technologies on the feared German U-Boat, in the intermittent and subsequent years he wrote his own notable work the “Electronic Engineering Handbook”. It was in this environment, where Ken Batcher’s was able to watch what is considered the first major new story to break on television: the attacks at Pearl Harbor. It was in this environment where Ken’s mind was fostered and able to flourish.</p2>
