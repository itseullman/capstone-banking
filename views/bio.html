    <p>
      “The Russians saved me!” laughed Dr. Johnnie Baker as he regaled me with
      the tales of his foundations in Computer Science, in a small conference
      room within the bowels of Kent State University's Mathematical Sciences
      Building. Kenneth Batcher’s beginnings had the same roots within the
      urgency to compete scientifically with Russia. In 1957, Sputnik 1 was
      launched by The Soviet Union, the first artificial Earth satellite to
      break into elliptical orbit. Ken Batcher had been working on an early
      version of a computer with Goodyear Aerospace at their Portsmouth Gaseous
      Diffusion Plant, producing uranium for the United States Atomic Energy
      Program. It was at this time Johnnie Baker remembered:
      <br />
      “the United States government thought they better put some money into math
      and science”
      <br />
      “and computers.” Added Dr. Batcher’s son, Dr. Kenneth Batcher jr.
      <br />
      This is where Dr. Batcher senior had his start in the world and
      development in computing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kenneth E. Batcher was born on December 27, 1935. Raised in the borough of
      Queens, New York City, he would never quite like the way of life in the
      city. Coming from a lineage of science and electronics, his father,
			<a href = "https://www.earlytelevision.org/batcher_articles.html" target = "_blank">Ralph R. Batcher</a>
			 was an early pioneer in the world of television, penning a
      column in the New York Sun for hobbyists to build their own versions of
      tube TVs. Graduating with a degree in Radio Engineering (Universities
      didn’t commonly offer electrical engineering degrees yet!) he spent both
      World Wars reverse engineering the technologies on the feared German
      U-Boat, in the intermittent and subsequent years he wrote his own notable
      work the “Electronic Engineering Handbook”. It was in this environment,
      where Ken Batcher’s was able to watch what is considered the first major
      new story to break on television: the attacks at Pearl Harbor. It was in
      this environment where Ken’s mind was fostered and able to flourish.

	<h1 align="center">Contributions</h1>
	<p>
	  Dr. Kenneth E. Batcher was a figurehead in the field of Computer
	  Science. He made numerous contributions and has left a lasting web of
	  influence on those he spent his time with and with the community at
	  large.
	</p>

	<p>
	  While working at Goodyear Aerospace and later at Kent State
	  University, Dr. Batcher’s mainstay was the areas of parallel
	  computation and associative computing. Associative computing is a term
	  created by Dr. Jerry Potter who worked closely with Dr. Batcher, and
	  the term essentially refers to everything in the realm of
	  computational parallelization, the use of both data parallel
	  programming and the ability to search memory by data content rather
	  than memory address[1].
	</p>

	<p>
	  Some of the most impactful projects that Dr. Batcher was involved with
	  were the development of two SIMD (single instruction, multiple data)
	  parallel processors known as the STARAN and the Massively Parallel
	  Processor (MPP), both of which were developed through Goodyear
	  Aerospace. These works later inspired the Goodyear ASPRO system, which
	  Dr. Batcher helped design initially before transitioning to Kent State
	  University [2][3].
	</p>

	<p>
	  The STARAN was one of the first major computers designed around
	  associative memory, and Dr. Batcher was its chief architect. It was
	  built around 1972 [2] and its main application was in Air Traffic
	  Control (ATC) systems. STARAN had multiple generations and was used by
	  Goodyear as a basis for research for at least 30 years [7].
	</p>

	<p>
	  Following STARAN around 1983 [2], was the Goodyear Massively Parallel
	  Processor (MPP). The MPP was originally built for NASA and was based
	  around earlier technology developed for the STARAN [8]. The MPP was
	  initially designed to quickly process satellite images, but it also
	  found many other research and project applications through NASA [9].
	  Only one MPP was ever developed and is now held within the Smithsonian
	  near the Space Shuttle Discovery [10].
	</p>

	<p>
	  Finally, the ASPRO was a second generation STARAN that was developed
	  around the time Dr. Batcher transitioned to Kent State University in
	  1989. While he did not head the development of the ASPRO, he still
	  worked closely with Goodyear in completing the system [11]. The ASPRO
	  itself was built specifically for use by the U.S. Navy for
	  surveillance, and it was even installed in Hawkeye Radar Planes in
	  order to provide ATC at sea and track enemy targets. It is estimated
	  that around 750 ASPROs were developed [12].
	</p>

	<p>
	  Dr. Batcher is also credited with discovering two parallel sorting
	  algorithms: the odd-even mergesort and the bitonic mergesort [3].
	  Odd-even mergesort is an algorithm for sorting networks of size O(n
	  (log n)2) and depth O((log n)2) [4]. Meanwhile, bitonic mergesort is
	  essentially a parallel version [5] which the STARAN, MPP, and ASPRO
	  all utilized in some variation [6].
	</p>

	<p>

	  patents:
